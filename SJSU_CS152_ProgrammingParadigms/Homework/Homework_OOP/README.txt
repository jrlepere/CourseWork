I have zipped all Scala projects under their respective names.

Problem 1: DnD
- For this problem, I tried to make the code reusable by creating a Character interface.
- I have a dungeon object for testing. I was not sure how the fighting should be, so
	I made something up. I also did not think it was fair to fix whoever attacked
	First. Therefore, I made the attacking random.
- A bit more commenting is added than was required.

Problem 3: Indus
- Pretty straight forward. Added a # in Stock parameter because I think there was one
	in the output form the sample. I also made it clear that the ID was incremented
	for each Item generated by putting this in the output as well.

Problem 4: Acorn
- I apologize for all of the classes. 
- All the necessary Expressions should be there and tested in the test.scala object.
- And/Or expressions also have short circuit implementation.

Problem 5: Weather
- There was not much direction with this problem.
- My understanding was that there is some given implementation for the CenTherm method.
	I just set the output to 1 or something so it would compile.
- Only class with work is the Adapter class following the adapter pattern. It extends
	the IThermometer Trait and has a CenTherm instance variable. The implemented
	method calculates the average temperature as if the CenTherm method was 
	defined correctly.
