By clicking control followed by space, we are able to identify methods to initize or get instance variables. This is a shortcut to creating these methods.4)DonePartD1)We received the error that the constructor in the Item class is undefined.2) I chose the Constructor() option.3)DonePartE1)Selection does not contain a main type2)The JFilerChooser library was implemented3)A list of several contrustors with different parameters are available to us4)A list of several methods are available to us5)Yes by using the atuo-complete option after the periods6)Done7)DonePartF1)The program runs but nothing is printed2)Done3)Done4) When we run the program now, the program runs successfully, adds the addresses from the saved document, and from our implemented code the program adds our email to the book variable. We can access our email by doing what we had done previously with the get method.PartG1)Done2)We get the error that the method getFirst() was not initialized in the AddressBook class.3)The code ran and returned the reference code for the first item in the array4) The item class5)Done6) A String containing the name, key, and value of the first address in the address book.
