Done7. It must be against the wall8. Done9. See Driver10. See Driver11. The MazeSolver program solves the program and prints every step of the robot inside the maze as well as an array of every position the robot has been at.12. Done13. Loop until isExit is foundPartB1. Done2. See Driver3. The program executes correctly when ran4. Done5. No, because we are making a clone and checking scenarios on that clone each time, a process known as branching.PartC1. Done. We get 10.2. Res = 3Return largest(values,1,3);3. Largest(new int[] {3,4,1},1,3)Res2 = 4;Return largers(values, 2, 4);4. Largest(values = {3,4,1}, 2, 4)Res2 = 4Return largest(values,3,4)5. Largest(values,3,4)Return 46. 47. This is easier than the triangle numbers because we return the final answer in the last call.PartD1. The program takes a while to execute.2. 7014087333. The program stops at the given n value at the breakpoint the program4. The n keeps getting smaller and smaller until 25. 250 run time stack6. first = f(n-1); second = f(n-2)7. n = 9; first = 21; second = 13n = 3; first = 1; second = 1;n = 4; first = 2; second = 1;n = 3; first = 1; second = 1;n = 5; first = 3; second = 2;8. This program runs so slowly because we have to calculate the f(n-1) and f(n-2) each time, which then calculates f(n-1) and f(n-2) for every f(n-1) or f(n-2) until we get to f(2).PartE1. See Driver2. The output is many Sep 25, 2015 4:04:40 PM RecursiveFib fib   INFO: Exiting fib. return=144 statements as well as n values.3. This shows the time4. See Driver5. The logging output is significantly less than previous, although still printing values as before.6. The code still takes a while to execute7. This runs the program without the red text from the logger being displayed in the console.8. I would create more Logger information inside the code and turn the setLevel to All. There are probably other methods where you could specifically set individual Loggers on and off inside the code.
