Some problems:
- mutating to unacceptable states
- breeding to unacceptable states
- Slow string processing
   - Changed to array of 1/0
- Keeping track of total fitness value
- Average and best fitness score not improving for new populations
   - Selection process was not ideal
   - Only select from top half of the population
- Improved initial state
- Mutate probability and population size
- Some configurations work better for lower n (almost perfect) while some configurations work average for all n
